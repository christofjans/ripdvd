This is a small Windows Powershell utility to rip CD/DVD-ROMs . It works on Windows Powershell but I don't think it would work on Powershell 7 .

Example usage:

```ps
./ripdvd.ps1 d: path_to_iso.iso
```

In the above example `d:` is your DVD-ROM and `path_to_iso.iso` is the path of the outputted ISO file.
